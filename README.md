## Features in Consideration
The site is now heading in the direction of a film review website, Ã  la _Rotten
Tomatoes_. Here are some proposed plans for it:

- Separating the film and review functionality into separate apps? The idea for
  an app is to do one thing and one thing _well_, so perhaps having one app 
  to serve as a film catalogue and another to serve as a film review app makes
  sense.
- An app for recommendations based on film tags? Could be cool to combine this
  with _Netflix_ style machine learning in order to recommend viewers films to
  see (and review).
- A React front-end is on the way, it just needs some designing. JavaScript or
  TypeScript? Functional or Class components? What toolkit? [Material Kit React](

  ) is apparently regarded quite highly, so it's worth a look.
