## Features in Consideration

The site is now heading in the direction of a film review website, Ã  la [Rotten
Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). Here are some proposed plans for it:

- Separating the film and review functionality into separate apps? The idea for
  an app is to do one thing and one thing _well_, so perhaps having one app 
  to serve as a film catalogue and another to serve as a film review app makes
  sense.
- Models for cast and crew.
- An app for recommendations based on film tags? Could be cool to combine this
  with [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) style machine learning in order to 
  recommend films to see (and review) to users.
- A React front-end is on the way, it just needs some designing. JavaScript or
  TypeScript? Functional or Class components? What toolkit? [Material Kit React](

  ) is apparently regarded quite highly, so it's worth a look.


## Overview

### Admin Site

The admin site, for managing your data, can be found at `http://localhost/admin`
